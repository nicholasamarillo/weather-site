# Purpose of the project
This project is a staple in the front end developement world. This is a project that allows me to get an understanding of using API's and their data. My current weather app that is on here is the base model of it. The project contains the city name, description of the current weather, current temp, and the highs and lows of the day. 

It's clear to me that I tend to say "this was the hardest project so far" but in reality every new project should be the hardest project you have worked on if you continue to learn new concepts and methods. I was having a really tough time about how to get the data. When looking at the OpenWeatherAPI website, I looked in the current weather section and used the first link that I saw. This link would reqire that I had the longitude and latitude of the city the user wanted to input. After some time, I did see that they had an api link that would just require the city name. 

There are some ideas that I have to upgrade and imporve the website. I would like to go with my original idea and have the background be dynamically changed based on the current city that the user is inputting. I would also like to implement a fahrenheit to celcius button that changes the unit of measure.
